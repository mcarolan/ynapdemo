    * (literal) expressions have types and produce values
    * types restrict allowed values
    * Scala has a static type system

    * all values in Scala are objects: groups of related data and methods with an identity
    * object method call syntax - infix / postfix
    * object literal syntax, with fields and method (specific cat example)
